    <h1>Medium Rare Steak</h1>
    <img src="image/MRsteak.jpg" alt="Medium rare steak">
    <p>This recipe is how to properly cook a steak. Steak is best served medium rare
       this is not an opinion but merely facts.</p> 
    </p>


    <p>You can use a grill (prefered) or use a cast iron pan, if you intend on using a pan
        consider reverse searing. Reverse searing is exactly what it sounds like. Typically 
        many people would sear a streak on all of it's surfaces and finish the steak by baking it,
        I tend to find a better end result by baking it to medium rare and finishing it on a pan.</p>
    </p>

    <h1> Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Cut of steak, New York Strip, T-bone Steak, Ribeye, these are all fine</li>
        <li>3 tbs butter</li>
        <li>1 tbs garlic</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>thyme (additional, not needed)</li>
        
    </ul>


    <h1> Step by Step</h1>
    <ol>

        <li>Start by grabbing your steak and seasoning it with salt and pepper on all surfaces</li>
        <li>Grab some aluminum foil and place your steak on top</li>
        <li>Add 2 tbs of butter and the seasoned steak wrapped around in aluminum foil</li>
        <li>Now you want to preheat your oven to 340</li>
        <li>place you wrapped steak in the oven for 30min</li>
        <li>After 30min take your steak out (it will still look pink all around)</li>
        <li>Dry off your steak by patting it down with a towel, you want your surface to be dry inorder to create a crust</li>
        <li>Heat up your cast iron skillet and place your steak in it</li>
        <li>You're looking to create a nice crust around the steak, the inside is already cooked from the oven</li>
        <li>once you've created a crust all around your steak add your garlic, thym & butter and lower the heat</li>
        <li>Base your steak with the butter for 2-3 min</li>
        <li>After you've seared the steak all around take the steak out and let it cool on a cooling rack</li>
        <li><em>IMPORTANT</em> you must allow your steak to rest on a cooling rack for 5-10min</li>
    </ol>
