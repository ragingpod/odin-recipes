    <p>Wagyu - a Japanese beef cattle breed â€“ derived from native Asian cattle. 'Wagyu' refers to all Japanese beef cattle, where 'Wa' means Japanese and 'gyu' means cow.

        Wagyu were originally draft animals used in agriculture, and were selected for their physical endurance. This 
        selection favored animals with more intra-muscular fat cells  marbling which provided a readily 
        available energy source. Wagyu are naturally horned and can be either black or red in color.</p>

        <li>Drop your credit card/debit card and wait within the researched resturant</li>
        <li>Although there are videos on how to properly cook A5 wagyu, you would rather have someone professional handle your steak that could cost anywhere from 250 and up.</li>
